On the last day of my internship at Facebook, my manager gave a gift, [The 7 HABITS Of HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) written by Stephen Covey. I have read the book twice since then and applied the principles in that books to my daily life. Even though the book does not remodel me, it changes my characters and life patterns fundamentally at least the private level, turning me to a truely independent person. The following parts are my thoughts on keypoints of that book.
