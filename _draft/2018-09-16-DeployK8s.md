title: "Install Kubernetes on a cluster of Virtual Machines"

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a great containerized application deployment system. This blog describes a way to set up a cluster of Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single host (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) and install kubernetes on these VMs. 

# Virtualbox
[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is used to create and manage VMs. Download and install Virtualbox according to [this instruction](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads).

## Create VMs
Follow [How To Create Your Own Cluster With VirtualBox](http://goinbigdata.com/how-to-create-your-own-cluster-with-virtualbox/). I create four nodes here, 

| VirtualBox Node Name | Linux Server Name | Port | ssh command                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---- | ----------------------------- |
| node-master          | vm-master         | 3022 | ssh -p 3022 ${USER}@localhost |
| node-worker1         | vm-worker1        | 3023 | ssh -p 3023 ${USER}@localhost |
| node-worker2         | vm-worker2        | 3024 | ssh -p 3024 ${USER}@localhost |
| node-worker3         | vm-worker3        | 3025 | ssh -p 3025 ${USER}@localhost |

To change the Linux server name (the host name shown on the terminal), first [edit /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg and set the parameter "preserve_hostname" from "false" to "true"](https://askubuntu.com/a/1028750), then `hostnamectl set-hostname 'vm-worker1'` and change the `/etc/hostname`. 

## Configure the Network
The next step is to build a network connecting these four nodes. The default network adapter is NAT. From [Table 6.1 Overview](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html), it does not support communication between vms.

1. Create a NAT network k8scluster with CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24. Disable DHCP as the 
1. For each vms enable Adapter 2. Attach it to NAT Network - k8sculster.
1. Config IP address for each vm. This is the hardest part. First find the new interface (k8scluster). 

```
ifconfig -a
enp0s3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
...

enp0s8: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        ether 08:00:27:e0:d7:7e  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
...
```

enp0s8 is the new one shown after we add the NAT Network. However, it has not been set yet. Append these lines to `/etc/network/interfaces`.
```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto enp0s8
iface enp0s8 inet static
        address 192.168.1.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
```
and run `ifup enp9s8`.

Then enp0s8 will have the expected ip and netmask.
```
enp0s8: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
        inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fee0:d77e  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:e0:d7:7e  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
```

and we can log in `vm-master` from another worker 
```
nobunaga@vm-worker1:~$ ssh nobunaga@192.168.1.1
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)' can't be established.
...

Last login: Sun Sep 16 17:59:33 2018 from 10.0.2.2
nobunaga@vm-master:~$
```
repeat this step for vm-worker{1/2/3} with ip addresses 192.168.1.{2/3/4} respectively. Add the ip hostname mapping to `/etc/hosts`.

```
192.168.1.1     vm-master
192.168.1.2     vm-worker1
192.168.1.3     vm-worker2
192.168.1.4     vm-worker3
```
It is convenient to add the public key of the master to all workers. Create two scripts
`add_key.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p .ssh/
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm ~/id_rsa.pub
```
and `pass_sshkey.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash
for vm in "vm-worker1" "vm-worker2"  "vm-worker3";
do
        scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub "nobunaga@${vm}:~"
        ssh nobunaga@${vm} 'bash -s' < add_key.sh
done
```

# Install Kubernetes
I use kubeadm to deploy k8s to a cluster.
1. [Install kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/#check-network-adapters).
1. [Initialize your master](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/#initializing-your-master). In this step config the network using [Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.2/getting-started/kubernetes/).
On the initialization succeeding, the console will print
> You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:
  kubeadm join 10.0.2.15:6443 --token 7sao85.25uuac4sn2ypph94 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:5daa2a0e0254b4c173f7bc13b8f1d7146a2b79594a079d9c71cc8113157a2cf8

1. Add workers to Kubernetes. In vm-worker{1,2,3}, run the command above.
